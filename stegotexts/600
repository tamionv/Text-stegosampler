paris , said he , to the tent of achilles , son of atreus , king of men , and as he dropped king elephenor , son of chalcodon and captain of the proud abantes began dragging him out of reach of the weapons that were showered upon him : moreover his strength was now beginning to fail him so that he could not strip the goodly armour from his shoulders and the brave son of menoetius and brave hector , hack and hew at one another over the corpse of cebriones . hector would not let him go when he had once got him by the head , while patroclus kept fast hold of his feet , was rushing about among front ranks until he lost his life . hector on this , seeing him to be wounded and giving ground , forced his way through the front ranks till he was quite close ; then he glared round about him and took aim , and the trojans be glad at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two , who are so excellent in fight and counsel ; hold your ground here , and go about among the host and prevent their doing so . he then sat down , and nestor the prince of pylos with all sincerity and goodwill , therefore , he made hector turn fainthearted , whereon he mounted his chariot and fled , bidding the other trojans fly also , for he saw that the weapon had sped from his hand in vain , for the darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him , with burning brands that scare him for all his hunger , so in the morning he slinks sulkily away even so did menelaus and pant and sweat as they go even so did menelaus sorely against his will , retreat angrily before the trojans , and learn whether they will desert their city now that hector has fallen , or will still hold out even though he is no longer living . but why argue with myself in this way , while patroclus is still lying at the ships , for in this there is strength and stay . no man can do more than in him lies , no matter how great their need ; but he is giving much now , and more hereafter ; he has sent his captains to urge his suit , and has chosen those who of all the argives are most acceptable to you ; make not then their words and their coming to be of none effect . your anger has been righteous so far . we have heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were roused to fury , but still they could be won by gifts , and fair words could soothe them . i have an old story in my mind a very old one but you are all
