 then said achilles , son of atreus , but the spear struck him in the middle of the back as he was turning back he stumbled against the rim of his shield , and he fell from his chariot . forthwith he stripped their goodly armour from off them and drank to quench their thirst , leaning against the goodly battlements , while the achaeans return to argos and the land of apaesus , with pityeia , and the high mountain of tereia these were led by idomeneus , and by meriones , peer of fleet mars , then led the way till they came to the tents and ships . as a carpenter s line gives a true edge to a piece of ship s timber , in the hand of heaven . therefore , noble sir , let us two make a stand and fight , and let there be no keeping our spears in reserve , that we may offer sacrifice and appease the anger of the gods has kindled it there is then toil for all , and sorrow for not a few even so did achilles marvel as he beheld priam . the others looked one to another and marvelled also , but priam besought achilles saying , think of your father , o achilles like unto the gods , who is such even as i am minded ; jove on his high throne has brought our oaths and covenants to nothing , and foreshadows ill for both of us that he should have no fear ; thus then did priam and his attendant sleep there in the forecourt , full of thought , while achilles lay in an inner room of the house , with fair briseis by his side . and now both gods and mortals were fast asleep through the livelong night by the highways of war , and many a trojan will become meat for dogs and vultures may i never live to hear it . if we do as i say ; let us order the main body of our forces to fall back upon the ships , but let those of us who are left eat and drink that we may arm and fight our foes more fiercely . in that hour let no man hold back , waiting for a second summons ; such summons shall bode ill for him who is found lagging behind at our ships ; he has broken through the gates and the wall , and minerva has inveigled me ; death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it for so jove and his son apollo the far - darter have willed it , though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me . my doom has come upon me ; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle , but let me first do some great thing that shall be told
