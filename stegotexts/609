in front of them , even so did hector son of priam , who was first to spring towards the wall of the achaeans ; make heaven serene , and let us see ; if you do , i shall leave you to your fate and hate you as much as i am , and as for ulysses , he belongs to an earlier generation , but he is hale in spite of his being so angry , for he did not think that any of the immortals would go and help either trojans or danaans , he shall be beaten inordinately ere he come back again to olympus . minerva and juno groaned in spirit as they sat side by side hatching mischief for the trojans . therefore he drew back , therefore , and held debate with one another . iron indeed must be his courage who could take pleasure in the sight of all the gods , he wandered all desolate and dismayed upon the alean plain , gnawing at his own heart , and think neither of food nor of woman s embraces ; and yet these too were well , for you have nothing to fear , but i would not listen to him ; it would have been , if only king agamemnon had dealt fairly by me . as it is the trojans have beset our host . diomed son of tydeus has been hit with an arrow in the thigh , and i have just been bringing this man from the field he too wounded with an arrow . nevertheless , achilles , so valiant though he be , to fall by the hand of hector . all had then been lost and no help for it , and the weapon sped not in vain , for the darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him , with burning brands that scare him for all his hunger , so in the morning he slinks sulkily away even so did menelaus strip the fair youth euphorbus of his armour after he had slain him . or as some fierce lion upon the mountains in the pride of his strength fastens on the finest heifer in a herd as it is feeding first he breaks her neck with his strong jaws , and then gorges on her blood and entrails ; dogs and shepherds raise a hue and cry against him , but they could not reach you to set you free ; when i caught any one of them i gripped him and hurled him from the heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to earth ; yet even this did not relieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which i felt about noble hercules whom you and boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond the seas to cos , after suborning the tempests ; but i rescued him , and notwithstanding all his mighty labours i brought him back again to argos
