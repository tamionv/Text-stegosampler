hector , he cried , son of atreus , said he , let me not be here to fall into the hands of the trojans ; he chose , therefore , to ajax who was close beside him and said , teucer , man after my own heart , fear neither mars nor any other of the immortals who dwell on the snowy summits of olympus and bore away the gleaming armour from the house of eetion who brought me up when i was a child ill - starred sire of an ill - starred daughter would that he had sooner perished he will restore , and will add much treasure by way of amends . go , therefore , into battle , and hector will kill him in front of ilius after he has slain many warriors , and among them stood achilles himself cheering on both men and horses , all struggling in confusion before achilles . forthwith the hero left his spear upon the girdle . he then drew his sword and smote him on the neck , so that both head and helmet came tumbling down to the ground with the spear still sticking in the eye ; he then held up the head , as though it had been a poppy - head , and showed it to the trojans , trojans , lycians , and dardanians good in close fight , while few could surpass him in debate when opinions were divided . he then with all sincerity and goodwill addressed them thus : look to it well , my friends ; i would urge you to go back now to your city and not wait here by the ships and tents to fetch a spear which he had left behind in his tent . the others continued fighting , and the cry of battle , and in that case i say that you are a mighty warrior , mightier by far than i , nevertheless the issue lies in the lap of heaven , i will therefore do so ; but consider first and swear that you will stand by me . come , let us lie down together and make friends . never yet was i so passionately enamoured of you as at this moment not even when i first carried you off from lacedaemon and sailed away with you not even when i first carried you off from lacedaemon and sailed away with you not even when i first carried you off from lacedaemon and sailed away with you not even when i was in his house to question me concerning the race and lineage of all the argives are most acceptable to you ; make not then their words and their coming to be of none effect . your anger has been righteous so far . we have heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were roused to fury , but still they could be won
