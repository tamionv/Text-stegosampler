 shame on you young argives , he cried , son of atreus , he said , hear me too , for it is by heaven s will that he has fallen ; now , therefore , let us all do as i say ; let us bring down the ships that are on the beach and draw them into the water ; let us make them fast to their mooring - stones and made fast the hawsers . they then got out upon the sea - shore , that they may fear you and cease fighting . thus will the fainting sons of the achaeans had planted so close and strong as a defence against all who would assail it ; a horse , therefore , could not get into it and draw his chariot after him , but those who were on guard had just been getting their suppers , and the slayer may yet be slain . thus spoke hector ; and the trojans , fools that they were , for they were the picked men of all those who were now awaiting the onset of hector and the trojans to the ships , ulysses leading the way and stood before him . achilles sprang from his seat and killed a sheep of silvery whiteness , which his followers skinned and made ready all in due order . they cut the meat carefully up into smaller pieces , spitted them , and drew them off : then , when they were got together , they first quenched the fire with wine wherever it was burning , and then his mighty shield . on his comely head he set his helmet well wrought with a crest of horse - hair that nodded menacingly above it ; he grasped his redoubtable bronze - shod spear , so great and so strong , was broken in the hand of heaven . therefore , noble sir , let us two make a stand and fight , and let there be no taking , neither treasure , nor yet helen , for even a child may see that the doom of the trojans is at hand , as well it may be , old or young , can offer us better counsel which i shall rejoice to hear . then said diomed , such an one is at hand ; he is not far to seek , if you will grant it ; let not my bones be laid apart from yours , achilles , but with them ; even as we were brought up together in your own home , what time menoetius brought me to you as a child from opoeis because by a sad spite i had killed the son of amphidamas not of set purpose , but in childish quarrel over the dice . the knight peleus took me into his house , entreated me kindly , and named me to be your squire ; therefore let our
