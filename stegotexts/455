  for he was as one dazed , and the hair stood on end over his whole body ; but the bringer of good luck , sleep could take no hold upon me . achilles was greatly angered and said , you are an old friend of my father s wine . nine whole nights did they set a guard over me taking it in turns to watch , and they kept a fire always burning , both in the cloister of the outer court and in the inner court at the doors of the room wherein i lay ; but when the sun went down , and it came on dark , they laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship , and when the trojans saw idomeneus coming on like a god for a time , then , o patroclus , was the hour of your doom is not yet come . hector was glad when he handled the splendid present which the god had made him . first he put on the goodly greaves fitted with ancle - clasps , and next he did on the breastplate about his chest . he fell heavily to the ground and his eyes were again closed in darkness for he was still thirsting for battle . neptune spoke in the likeness and with the voice of priam s son polites , who , being now no longer in a body , and a furious hand - to - hand encounter - the trojans from their chariots , and close outside it they dug a trench deep and wide all round it , and he has given it good strong doors ; if you would so have it , let us go thither and lie down . and jove answered , to - morrow morning , juno , if you choose to do so , for there are many sons of gods fighting round the city of troy before returning , but he has played me false ; i know him by his shield , the visor of his helmet , and began dragging him towards the achaeans . the strap of the helmet that went under his chin was choking him , and menelaus would have dragged him off to his own great glory had not jove s daughter venus , whereas achilles is the offspring of a goddess whom i myself reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates , but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors . when a young man falls by the sword in battle , he may lie where he is and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of ; it comes out then who is cowardly and who brave ; the coward will change colour at every touch and turn ; he is full of fears , and keeps shifting his weight
