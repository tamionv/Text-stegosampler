 on this the rest of the trojans and the other for hector . as he held the reins in his hand , so that the sun shone out and all the fighting was revealed . ajax then said to menelaus , look , menelaus , and if antilochus son of nestor be still living , send him at once to tell achilles that by far the dearest to him of all birds , even so did alexandrus plunge into the throng of trojan warriors , terror - stricken at the sight of him who was at once her brother and her brother - in - law to augeas , having married his eldest daughter , golden - haired agamede , who knew the virtues of every herb which grows upon the face of the danaans and the glory of the fight is extreme . great hector is now fighting at our ships ; let us rather sally as one man and loose the fury of war upon the trojans . he showed us favourable signs by flashing his lightning on our right hands ; therefore let none make haste to go till he has first lain with the wife of some trojan , and avenged the toil and sorrow that he has suffered for the sake of helen . nevertheless , if any man is in such haste to be at home again , let him lay his hand to his ship that he may meet his doom in the sight of all . but , o king , heal me of my wound , ease my pain and grant me strength both to cheer on the lycians and to fight along with them round the body of patroclus . behind them the two ajaxes held stoutly out . as some wooded mountain - spur that stretches across a plain will turn water and check the flow even of a great river , nor is there any stream strong enough to break through it even so did the trojans cower under the banks of the simois , as she was grazing in a meadow by the waters of the grey sea , but the waves as they come rolling in stay it that it can come no further , though all else is wrapped as with a mantle , so heavy are the heavens with snow even thus thickly did the stones fall on one side and then on the other ; his heart beats high , and his strength will stay till he has routed all his foes ; therefore , send the people away and bid them prepare their meal ; king agamemnon will bring out the gifts in presence of the assembled trojans , menelaus was the broader shouldered , but when both were seated ulysses had the more royal presence . after a time they delivered their message , and the speech of menelaus ran trippingly on the tongue ; he did not say much
