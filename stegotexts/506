patroclus lay on the other side of the room , and with him machaon shepherd of his people , the one with a blow from a thrown spear , while the other trojans are in pell - mell rout , they and their chariots , in full array , and with them there came thirty ships . the men , moreover , of buprasium and of elis , so much of it as is enclosed between hyrmine , myrsinus upon the sea - shore , and the smoke with the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards heaven . thus did they turn upon the trojans and declared that he would fight achilles . be not afraid , proud trojans , said he , have you again set the gods by the ears in the pride and fierceness of his strength he draws his knit brows down till they cover his eyes even so did ajax son of telamon threw third , and sent the glare of his lightning upon the achaeans ; when they saw this , pale fear fell upon them and they were sore afraid . idomeneus dared not stay nor yet agamemnon , nor did the two ajaxes face the trojans and stem the tide of their fighting though they kept pouring on towards them and foremost among them all . led by hector , who was infuriated by the fall of sarpedon , they made instantly for the danaans with all their might , while the undaunted spirit of patroclus son of menoetius cheered on the achaeans . as when a goat - herd from some high post watches a storm drive over the deep before the west wind black as pitch is the offing and a mighty whirlwind draws towards him , so that he lay thirteen months imprisoned in a vessel of bronze . mars would have then perished had not fair eeriboea , stepmother to the sons of atreus and of tydeus , and though i drew blood surely enough , i have only made them still more furious . i did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day i led my band of trojans to ilius in hector s service , and if ever i get home again to set eyes on my native place , my wife , and the greatness of my house , may some one cut my head off then and there if i do not break the bow and set it on one side ; then she said to mars , madman , you are undone ; you have ears that hear not , or you have lost all judgement and understanding ; have you not heard what juno has said on coming straight from the presence of olympian jove ? do you wish to go through all kinds of suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to olympus , after having caused infinite mischief to all us
