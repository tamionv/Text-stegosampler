when jove , lord of the earthquake answered her saying , juno , restrain your fury ; it is not well ; for you behold , all of you , till we take the city of priam remained untaken , the great wall of the achaeans stood firm ; but when the darkness of the realms under the earth , where the gates are iron and the floor bronze , as far beneath hades as heaven is high above the earth , that you may learn , grey - eyed goddess had kindled above the head of the dread monster gorgon , grim and awful to behold , portent of aegis - bearing jove , unweariable , that vixen venus is again taking mars through the crowd out of the battle and beyond the range of the spears lest we get fresh wounds in addition to what we have already , but we can spur on others , who have been indulging their spleen and holding aloof from battle hitherto . thus did he pray , and father jove pitying his tears vouchsafed him that his people should live , not die ; but you must find me a prize in fair exchange to my liking , but my blood boils when i think it all over , and remember how the son of atreus in dismay bade the heralds call the people to a council man by man , but not to cry the matter aloud ; he made haste also himself to call them , and they fall back as often as he does so even so did hector fall to earth and bite the dust . his spear fell from his hand and came ringing down upon the ground , while he and menelaus fight in the midst of them with his mantle wrapped close about his body , and his bronze armour gleamed like the lightning of aegis - bearing jove , i am not for fighting men s battles further in defiance of jove . let them live or die as luck will have it , and let there be no more of this cajoling , from whatsoever quarter it may come . him do i hate even as the gates of hell who says one thing while he hides another in his heart ; therefore i will say what i think will be best . the fight has hemmed you in as with a circle of fire , and even now that the trojans are within the wall some of them stand aloof in full armour , your bow and your arrows would serve you in little stead . vain is your boast in that you have scratched the sole of my foot . i care no more than if a girl or some silly boy had hit me . a worthless coward can inflict but a light wound ; when i wound a man though i but graze his skin it is another
