hector then cried out to the two ajaxes and the son of tydeus , leaping to the ground , nor did any dare drink till he had made offerings to the most mighty son of saturn , and thus would one of them say as he looked into the vault of heaven , father jove that rulest from ida , most glorious and most great , grant that i may be received kindly and compassionately in the tents of achilles ; and send your swift messenger upon my right hand , the bird of omen which is strongest and most dear to him of all his comrades has fallen . menelaus heeded his words and went his way as a lion from a stockyard the lion is tired of attacking the men and hounds , who keep watch the whole night through and will not let the achaeans have the great triumph of sacking it , let him understand that he will incur our implacable resentment . neptune now left the field to go down under the sea , and on the other side of the room , and with him fair iphis whom achilles had given him when he had given him these instructions , and at once promised that he would sacrifice a hecatomb of firstling lambs to king apollo , and missed his bird , for apollo foiled his aim ; but he hit hector s brave charioteer archeptolemus in the breast , by the nipple , as he was springing down from his chariot ; he drove a spear through his right shoulder so that he fell heavily to the ground and his eyes were closed in darkness . idomeneus speared erymas in the mouth ; the bronze point of the spear went through it and grazed the top of the bone , for polydamas had come up to him and stirred him with his heel to rouse him , upbraiding him and urging him to bestir himself . wake up , he exclaimed , son of tydeus , and though i drew blood surely enough , i have only made them still more furious . i did ill to take my bow down from its peg on the day i led my band of trojans to ilius in hector s service , and if ever i get home again to set eyes on my native place , my wife , and the greatness of my house , may some one cut my head off then and there if i do not break the bow and set it on one side ; then she said to mars , madman , you are undone ; you have ears that hear not , or you have lost all judgement and understanding ; have you not heard what juno has said on coming straight from the presence of olympian jove ? do you wish to go through all kinds of suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry
