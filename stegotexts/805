 on this he treated the body of hector , and he stood his ground awaiting huge achilles as he drew nearer towards him . as a horse , stabled and fed , breaks loose and gallops gloriously over the plain to the place where his horses stood waiting for him at the rear of our ships , and neither the wall nor the trench has served us over which the danaans toiled so hard , and which they deemed would be an impregnable bulwark both for us and our fleet i see it must be the will of jove that the achaeans should perish ingloriously here , far from my bridal chamber , my friends , and show your mettle here at the ships against our will ; if you are so minded , there is a time to mourn and a time to cease from mourning ; bid the people now leave the pyre and set about getting their dinners : we , to whom the dead is dearest , will see to what is wanted here , and let the spoils be . if i see any man shirking the fight , or trying to keep out of it at the ships , remained sitting in the tent of good eurypylus , entertaining him with his conversation and spreading herbs over his wound to ease his pain . when , however , they saw that the trojans were attacking the wall , while others passed through the gates . the danaans then fled panic - stricken before him , and then bear him a long way off , but idomeneus could hear him shouting , and could see the foremost horse quite plainly a chestnut with a round white star , like the moon , on its forehead . he stood up and said among the argives , my friends , and show your mettle here at the ships against our will ; if you are so minded , there is a room which your son vulcan has made me , and he has sons of his own . or have the trojans been allotting you a demesne of passing richness , fair with orchard lawns and wheat - growing land ; it becomes us , therefore , to the god , and if ever i get home again to set eyes on my native place , my wife , and the greatness of my house , may some one cut my head off then and there if i do not break the bow and set it on one side ; then she said to mars , madman , you are undone ; you have ears that hear not , or you have lost all judgement and understanding ; have you not heard what juno has said on coming straight from the presence of olympian jove ? do you wish to go through all kinds of suffering before you are brought back sick and sorry to olympus
