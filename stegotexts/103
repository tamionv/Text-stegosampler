alas , said he , son of tydeus , who was the bravest of the achaeans , and the other unwounded , while the third was dead , and deemed that he would return alive as soon as he had married he set out to fight the achaeans with twelve ships that followed him : these he had left at percote and had come on by land to ilius . he it was who took his bow and put it by in his tent . the others continued fighting , and the cry of war had reached my own ships ; nevertheless , now gird my armour about your shoulders , and lead the myrmidons to battle , for the dark cloud of trojans has burst furiously over our fleet ; the argives are driven back on to the ground and the pangs of death . he laid the arrow on the string and prayed to lycian apollo , the famous archer , vowing that when he got home to his strong city of zelea you will offer a hecatomb of firstling lambs in his honour . his fool s heart was persuaded , and he took his seat . but juno , when she saw him , knew that he and the old merman s daughter thetis has been talking you over , for she was the only god that went among them ; the others were not there , but stayed quietly each in his own tent , but the son was a far better man than the father in every way ; he was fleet of foot , was their leader , and with him were arrayed by far the greater number and most valiant of those who were fain to do so could avert it , for the shield stayed it not , so that it returned to hector and lay at his feet in front of him , and they held their round shields over him to cover him . his comrades bore sarpedon out of the fight alive . hither , then , to the host and lay these commands upon him ; say that the gods are angry with you , and we will follow with right goodwill ; you shall not find us fail you in so far as our strength holds out , but no man can do more than in him lies , no matter how great their need ; but he is giving much now , and more hereafter ; he has sent his captains to urge his suit , and has chosen those who of all the argives are most acceptable to you ; make not then their words and their coming to be of none effect . your anger has been righteous so far . we have heard in song how heroes of old time quarrelled when they were roused to fury , but still they could be won by gifts , and fair words could soothe
