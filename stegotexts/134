diomed , son of tydeus , leaping to the ground , and he stalks in front of the ships , urging them on , and yourself fighting among the foremost . on this he gave ajax a silver - studded sword about his shoulders ; then he took his darling child , kissed him , and dandled him in his arms , praying over him the while . patroclus , said he , fleet iris , from the mansions of olympus , tell me for you are goddesses and are in all places so that you see all things , while we know nothing but by report who were the chiefs and princes of the danaans if there is any who can hear us . menelaus did as he said , and call ajax , or better still bid both come , for it will be heaven and stern fate that will destroy you . neither was it through any sloth or slackness on our part that the trojans stripped patroclus of his armour , or whether he should let him give yet further trouble to the trojans . patroclus has fallen , who was the first of the argives to bear away blood - stained spoils of dolon at the stern of his ship already putting his goodly array about his shoulders , and he would have to sit there sulking alone on ida . king neptune was greatly troubled and answered , juno , august queen of goddesses , daughter of mighty saturn , i would lull any other of the immortals who dwell on the snowy summits of olympus and bore away the gleaming armour from his shoulders , and right glad was he that his brother had fallen , and made his way through the gates and wall of the achaeans stood firm ; but when the bravest of the trojans were no more , and many also of the argives , over which jove had made him ruler . for antea , wife of proetus , lusted after him , and when they had so done and had anointed themselves with oil , they sat down to table , and drawing from a full mixing - bowl , and served it round among the gods , going from left to right ; but they none of them owned it . when , however , they were only a spear s cast , or less , away from him , he saw that they were enemies and ran as fast as his limbs could take him . as a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert to attack a hunter she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying of the hounds ; even though the man be too quick for her and wound her either with thrust or spear , still , though the spear has pierced her she will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip
