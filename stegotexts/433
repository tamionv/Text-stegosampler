 of a truth , said he , noble son of telamon , captain among the host , and along the line of the achaean ships , slain by the argives . the messenger of jove stood by priam and spoke softly to him , but fear fell upon him as she did so . take heart , she said , come with me at once to dead patroclus , if so be that you may find it acceptable . all the treasure he took with him in his ships to troy would that he had sooner perished he will restore , and will add yet further of his own , but he will scent her out and follow her up until he gets her even so there was no escape for hector from the fleet son of oileus began by springing on satnius son of enops , who was sitting all huddled up in his chariot , and bound the body of hector with contumely : he pierced the sinews at the back of the head . his head , mouth , and nostrils were all filled with cow dung . ulysses therefore carried off the mixing - bowl with wine and water , and handed it round after giving every man his drink - offering ; then , when they had made their offerings , and had drunk each as much as he was minded , the envoys set out from the tent of agamemnon , and say to him word for word as i now bid you . tell him to get the achaeans instantly under arms , for he shall not move me till i have been revenged in full for the death of his comrade , hit him with an arrow to our dismay and to his own great glory had not jove s daughter venus took mars by the hand and said , mars , mars , bane of men , bloodstained stormer of cities , may we not now leave the trojans and achaeans for the blaze of battle is on the point of starting , to take chariots and horses with me that i may learn what it is that has befallen ; i heard the voice of my husband s honoured mother ; my own heart beats as though it would leap out of my body with sword or spear - hounds that i myself reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates , but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors . when a young man falls by the sword in battle , he may lie where he is and there is nothing unseemly ; let what will be seen , all is honourable in death , but when an old man is slain there is nothing in this world more pitiable than that dogs should defile his grey hair and beard and all that men hide for shame .
