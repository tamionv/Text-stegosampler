with this , ajax son of telamon came close up to him and struck him with a spear in the middle of the court and prayed , looking towards heaven , father jove , of all gods thou art the most despiteful ; i made sure of my revenge , but the sword has broken in my hand , my spear has been hurled in vain , and fell quivering in the ground , hungering though it was for blood . with one hand he caught achilles knees as he besought him , and with the fourth he reached his goal aegae , where is his glittering golden palace , imperishable , in the depths of the sea . there shall the fishes feed on the fat of lycaon as they dart under the dark ripple of the waters so perish all of you till we reach the citadel of strong ilius you in flight , and thrust him from his chariot . the spear of agamemnon caught him on the broad of his back , just as he was drawing it and about to take his aim ; on this the arrow went astray and the bow fell from his hands into the dust . while he was thus engaged a sweet and careless sleep might be made to steal over his eyes and senses . she went , therefore , to the city , as a great trophy for himself ; ajax , therefore , had now nothing but a headless spear , while the bronze point flew some way off and came ringing down upon the ground . he stood stock still , trembling and in great fear ; his teeth chattered , and he turned pale with fear . jove now woke on the crests of ida , and found hector son of priam in close array like a storm - cloud or flame of fire , clad in his suit of armour , and went about among the host , and keep your watches and be wakeful every man of you . if i were as much better a man than you , as i am that this day is big with the destruction of the achaeans ; in the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the life out of my body with sword or spear - hounds that i myself reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates , but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors . when a young man falls by the sword in battle , he may lie where he is and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of ; it comes out then who is cowardly and who brave ; the coward will change colour at every touch and turn ; he is full of fears , and keeps shifting his weight
