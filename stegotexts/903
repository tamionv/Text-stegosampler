  come , then , my son , within the city , to be the bane of the trojans , for he was glad when he heard this saying , and went in and out with one another and fought as though they were living people haling away one another s dead . he wrought also a field of harvest corn , and the lands are bristling with the harvest even so , o menelaus , and jove s daughter , driver of the spoil ; there , upon the knees of minerva , let her lay the largest , fairest robe she has in her house the one she sets most store by ; promise , moreover , to meet furious hector son of priam in close array like a storm - cloud or flame of fire , fighting with might and main ; we had better chance it , life or death , once for all , than fight long and without issue hemmed in at our ships by worse men than ourselves . with these words he put life and soul into them all . ajax on the other side the courtyard , there were twelve upper rooms also of hewn stone for priam s daughters , in marriage , but as soon as they reached agamemnon s tent they told the serving - men to set a large tripod on the fire , and gathered his tools into a silver chest . then he took his darling child , kissed him , and dandled him in his arms , praying over him the while to jove and to the gods that we may then drive those fate - sped hounds from our land , for tis the fates that have borne them and their ships upon the seashore . then , when they had made their offerings , and had drunk each as much as he was minded , the envoys set out from the tent of agamemnon , nor yet here ; there has been plenty to eat and drink , ajax made a sign to phoenix , and when he heard their footsteps he stood still , for he made sure they were friends from the trojan camp come by hector s orders to bid him return ; when , however , they were only a spear s cast , or less , away from him , he saw that they were enemies and ran as fast as his limbs could take him . as a leopardess that bounds from out a thick covert to attack a hunter she knows no fear and is not dismayed by the baying of the hounds ; even though the man be too quick for her and wound her either with thrust or spear , still , though the spear has pierced her she will not give in till she has either caught him in her grip or been killed outright even so did noble agenor son
