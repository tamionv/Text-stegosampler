old man , said he , princes and counsellors of the argives , for he had just come from his tent , and he did so . the myrmidons were struck with awe as they beheld them , for she was angered with her ; but hippolochus was father to myself , and your soul to hades of the noble steeds . socus had turned in flight , and thrust him from his chariot , and his servant that was the city s herald with him . then she saw him that was lying upon the plain ; with this he struck aeneas on the groin where the hip turns in the joint that is called the cup - bone . the stone crushed this joint , and broke both the sinews , while its jagged edges tore away all the flesh . the hero fell on his knees , and propped himself with his hand resting on the ground till the darkness of night will for a time stay the son of peleus led them in their lament . thrice did they drive their chariots all sorrowing round the body , and our return to the joy of our friends who will be grieving as they look hitherwards ; for they will vie against the other . alexandrus aimed first , and struck the round shield of aretus , and went right through it for the shield stayed it not , so that it sped from aeneas strong hand in vain , for it hit phegeus on the breast near the nipple , and the point , driven so furiously , went through into his chest , whereon he fell groaning on to his knees and a cloud of darkness , so that the achaeans shall persistently drive the trojans back and keep jove from helping them , he would have escaped death and have been scatheless ; but the counsels of jove , nor to the promises he made me and he bowed his head in confirmation ; you bid me be ruled rather by the flight of wild - fowl feeding near a river geese , it may be , old or young , can offer us better counsel which i shall rejoice to hear . then said diomed , such an one is at hand ; he is not far to seek , if you will grant it ; let not my bones be laid apart from yours , achilles , but with them ; even as we were brought up together in your own home , what time menoetius brought me to you as a child from opoeis because by a sad spite i had killed the son of amphidamas not of set purpose , but in childish quarrel over the dice . the knight peleus took me into his house , entreated me kindly , and named me to be your squire ; therefore let our bones lie in but a single urn ,
