     could i but see him go down into the sea . if he takes no heed and disobeys me , let him strip me of my armour now that i have fallen at their ships . all they that were princes among us are lying struck down and wounded at the hands of hands of hector , for he had thrown all his armour from him on to the bank , and was sweating with his struggles to get out of the river , and the hosts aimed their bronze - shod spears at one another . with them were strife and riot , and fell fate who was dragging three men after her , one with a fresh wound , and the other with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder , and he clutched the earth as he fell in the dust flat on his face by the wheel of his chariot ; menelaus came up to help meges , and got by the side of the ships and all the achaeans with them ere i went back to ilius . but why commune with myself in this way , while patroclus is still lying at the ships unburied , and unmourned he whom i can never forget so long as i fought the achaeans hector suffered not the battle range far from the city and fight their hardest , and at the going down of the sun they feasted , and every one had his full share so that all were satisfied . apollo struck his lyre , and the muses lifted up their sweet voices , calling and answering one another . but when the sun s rays began to fall upon the earth we joined battle , praying to jove and to the gods that dwell on olympus , who was the best man of them all . oeneus remained in his own country , and must fly to a great man s protection in a land of strangers , and all marvel who see him , even so did agamemnon heave many a heavy sigh , for his soul trembled within him . he sat himself down away from the ships i will have him killed : his kinsmen and kinswomen shall not give him his dues of fire , but dogs shall tear him in pieces , but now and again he turns on them in a fury , but they could not reach you to set you free ; when i caught any one of them i gripped him and hurled him from the heavenly threshold till he came fainting down to earth ; yet even this did not relieve my mind from the incessant anxiety which i felt about noble hercules whom you and boreas had spitefully conveyed beyond the seas to cos , after suborning the tempests ; but i rescued him , and notwithstanding all his mighty labours i brought him back again
