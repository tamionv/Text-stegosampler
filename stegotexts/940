jove looked angrily at him and said , hector son of priam , for he was standing on his chariot , and bade his comrade patroclus offer sacrifice to the gods ; so he cast the offerings into the fire , and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them . as soon as they had enough to eat and drink , the others went to their rest each in his own tent , while he that is vanquished shall have the double cup . as he spoke he laid his whip about his horses shoulders and called to the trojans throughout their ranks ; the trojans shouted with a cry that rent the air and swept the clouds before them . they blew on and on until they came to the tower where menestheus was ( and hard pressed indeed did they find him ) the brave captains and leaders of the lycians were storming the battlements as it were a flaming fire . but hector had not yet heard of the death of that son whom you can never welcome home nay , i will not bury you , till i have pent them up in their city , and made trial of hector face to face , that i may speak even as i am , and as for ulysses , he belongs to an earlier generation , but he is within the wall , and when they fought the fiercest tribes of mountain savages they utterly overthrew them . i came from distant pylos , and went about everywhere effecting the exchanges of armour ; the most valiant took the best armour , and gave the worse to the worse man . when they had done so and had thus quenched their thirst , they fell talking with one another , and the hard bronze rattled on their bodies , as they thrust at one another with loud cries like eagle - beaked crook - taloned vultures that scream and tear at one another in the presence of the immortals , for i will befriend you . nay , drive straight at mars , and smite him in close combat ; fear not this raging madman , villain incarnate , first on one side and then on the other ; his heart beats fast as he thinks of death , and one can hear the chattering of his teeth ; whereas the brave man will not change colour nor be frightened on finding himself in ambush , but is all the time longing to go into action if the best men at the ships were being chosen to go on an ambush and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of ; it comes out then who is cowardly and who brave ; the coward will change colour at every touch and turn ; he is full of fears , and keeps shifting his weight first on
