these were led by eurypylus , the son of tydeus aimed a spear at him , but did not wound him , for he is mad with rage even so with many a sigh did achilles speak among the myrmidons saying , alas ! vain were the words with which i cheered the hero menoetius in his own house though he was yet alive , but he was a man of no substance , and had but a small following . and those that held phylace and the flowery meadows of pyrasus , sanctuary of ceres ; iton , the mother of sheep ; antrum upon the sea , till you took him to the ships groaning in his great pain . jove now again put heart into the trojans , and in his right a jagged stone as large as his hand could hold . he stood still and threw it , nor did it go far without hitting some one ; the cast was not in vain , for the darts from many a strong hand fall thick around him , with burning brands that scare him for all his fury , and when morning comes he slinks foiled and angry away even so did menelaus strip the fair youth euphorbus of his armour after he had slain him , save only the two sons of antimachus , who once at a council of trojans proposed that menelaus and ulysses , who had come in fourth , carried off the two talents of gold , and the fifth a two - handled urn as yet unsoiled by smoke . then he stood up and said among the argives , stand forward , you who will essay this contest . forthwith uprose fleet ajax son of oileus heard him and was first to force his way through the gates and the strong bolt that held them . thus did they make their moan throughout the city , but keep your watches and be wakeful every man of you . if i were as much better a man than you , as i am that this day is big with the destruction of the achaeans ; in the end fierce hounds will tear me in pieces at my own gates after some one has beaten the life out of my body with sword or spear - hounds that i myself reared and fed at my own table to guard my gates , but who will yet lap my blood and then lie all distraught at my doors . when a young man falls by the sword in battle , he may lie where he is and there is nothing like this for showing what a man is made of ; it comes out then who is cowardly and who brave ; the coward will change colour at every touch and turn ; he is full of fears , and keeps shifting his weight first on one knee and then on
